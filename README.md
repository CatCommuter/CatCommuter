# MobileApp

## App Description:

This app helps people plan which bus to get to get from point A to point B. Can use Cattracks or Merced City Buses.

## App Design:

We intend to program the app in C#, and make it work on Android, iOS, and Windows devices.


## Users:

Any commuter who uses the UC Merced Cattracks bus system.


## Impact:

This app will make commuting easier in Merced, and enable people to find the optimal rute quickly and efficiently. The app should be open source, enabling future developers to continue updating the bus schedule for years to come.
